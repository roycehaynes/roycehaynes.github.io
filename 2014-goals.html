                        <p>This is my first time <em>publicly</em> writing about my annual goals, or any goals for that matter. I typically write them in a notebook or my Mac's text editor, then share them with <a href="http://instagram.com/p/P_QP_8nTKE/">Tamara</a>. This routine has worked <em>okay</em>, but its largely been ineffective and loose.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean Tamara hasn't been a good support person. She's always cheered me on. Usually through <em>packaged</em> messages, reminding me that I have moobs or need to follow through with X. <strong>The problem has been me</strong> not honoring those goals. </p>
<p>If I had a blame card to give out it would say, "<strong>Royce doesn't document or track annual goals wisely</strong>". </p>
<p>So for 2014 it felt right to put my goals <em>out there</em>. The plan is to reflect next December on what went well and what didn't, sorta like <a href="http://justinmares.com/2013-goals-how-did-i-do/">Justin Mares 2013 reflection post</a> but with more swagger. I also plan to track everything on a domain (more about this below). Hopefully the experience is insightful. </p>
<p>Welp, here goes a new thing...</p>
<h4>10 goals for 2014</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go on (minimum) 12 dates with Tamara.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay off debt (i.e., student loans) and have a net worth of $0 or more. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read 12 books from front to back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write 12 <a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2011/08/why-i-blog.html">quality and useful</a> blog posts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recieve A+ grade on 3 CS graduate courses (Taking 3 classes at CU Boulder next year towards CS Masters). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise 208 times for at least a full hour (At a rate of 4 times a week).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce body fat by 8 percent. Currently at 26.6 percent. Note: Follow Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23moobdiet&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime">#moobdiet</a> for updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create one or more software-oriented products that generates $20,000 in revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go on a 1 mile jog with <a href="http://instagram.com/p/ihKqTRnTMS/">Layla</a> once a month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase emotional and spirtual energy. Note: I'll do this by reviewing techniques from <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/leadership/resources/Manage%20Your%20Energy%20Not%20Your%20Time.pdf">Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time</a> once a month, meditating daily, and showing appreciation often.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>How I plan to measure</h4>
<p>I'll be using a mix of Fitbit, Foursquare, Google Cal, and other stuff for measurement and progress. <strong>All data will be viewable at a new site (royce.io), which isn't up yet but will be soon</strong>. I'll be using APIs for most of the data, other data will be punched in manually. You can think of royce.io as a <a href="http://x.naveen.com/post/51808692792/a-personal-api">quantified selfie</a> site that serves as a one-stop progress dashboard. I'll <a href="https://twitter.com/roycehaynes">tweet</a> about the new site when its shipped.</p>
<p>As far as that last goal, I hope to compile feedback from Tamara (pretty sure she'll have tons of it), local friends and family. I'll summerize this feedback along with stats from royce.io in the <em>end of 2014 results post.</em></p>
<p>Anyway, wish me luck. Happy New Year! As for you...</p>
<p><em>What are your goals? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/roycehaynes">Twitter</a></em></p>

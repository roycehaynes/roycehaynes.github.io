As a new tradition, I'm writing twenty-nine things I've learned in twenty-nine years.<ul><li><p>Whenever a friend is on your mind contact them.</p><li><p>If you believe but don't expect you will never receive.</p><li><p>Take time to understand your interest and values; it'll help you focus, live more, and get ahead.</p><li><p>Expectation is acting on what you believe (your faith) before you see it.</p><li><p>You'll never have a breakthrough year if you focus on a breakdown year.</p><li><p>Money is a medium. Wealth is value.</p><li><p>Goals should always be aligned with values.</p><li><p>Under schedule and you'll have meaningful time to reflect and engage in leisure.</p><li><p>Like what you have to do; don’t do too much of it; get the most out of the free time that remains.</p><li><p>Stand out by means other than simply outworking peers.

Remember this and you'll be full of Earth.</p><li><p>I don't like seeing my mom cry; losing my brother was emotional and still is.</p><li><p>Node.js isn't that bad.</p><li><p>I feel naked without a wristwatch on. I like watches.</p><li><p>Shipping is hard. Fitting a culture unlike you is even harder.</p><li><p>Marriage is cooler than I imagined; Tamara makes it beautiful.</p><li><p>Time swiftly passes.</p><li><p>Learning to think big is easier when you focus on less and meditate.</p><li><p>Knowing people use software I've open source is soothing.</p><li><p>I was reminded recently that understanding how to perform CPR is important. Learn.</p><li><p>Tamara and I are living a pretty awesome life.

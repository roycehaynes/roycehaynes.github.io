                        <p>Today I turned twenty-nine. As a new tradition, I'm writing twenty-nine things I've learned in twenty-nine years.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whenever a friend is on your mind contact them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you believe but don't expect you will never receive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take time to understand your interest and values; it'll help you focus, live more, and get ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expectation is acting on what you believe (your faith) before you see it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You'll never have a breakthrough year if you focus on a breakdown year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money is a medium. Wealth is value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goals should always be aligned with values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under schedule and you'll have meaningful time to reflect and engage in leisure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like what you have to do; don’t do too much of it; get the most out of the free time that remains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand out by means other than simply outworking peers. Be impressive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximize rewards and interesting opportunities afforded while minimizing time investment and schedule footprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've defeated statistics but my impact in society is not done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A certain substance is really good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I finally came to the realization that I will never get "into" sports. It's just not me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leaving Facebook and Instagram wasn't hard. It only made Twitter more interesting and valuable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being a star was never in God's plans. Remember this and you'll be full of Earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't like seeing my mom cry; losing my brother was emotional and still is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Node.js isn't that bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel naked without a wristwatch on. I like watches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shipping is hard. Fitting a culture unlike you is even harder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marriage is cooler than I imagined; Tamara makes it beautiful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time swiftly passes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning to think big is easier when you focus on less and meditate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowing people use software I've open source is soothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was reminded recently that understanding how to perform CPR is important. Learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tamara and I are living a pretty awesome life. I'm continuously happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vinyl records sound warmer than digital records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tattoos will be in my near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want an experience, not money, not celebrity.</p>
</li>
</ul>

                        <p>There are several sites that help parents find a nanny, like care.com, sittercity.com, or your local nanny placement agency. These services are great for setting up child care, but there is a growing number of parents who want to share their nanny with a family (or two).</p>
<p>You can imagine why this would be extremely useful (i.e., split costs, lessen commute, etc). It's a win-win (winning!) because the families get exceptional child care for half the cost, and the nanny gets paid a few bucks more a hour. The challenge is finding a family can be difficult, especially if you want parents who live nearby and share your schedule. Wouldn't it be awesome if you could just go to a site and set-up a nanny share in seconds?</p>
<p><strong>Try Pareday.com if you want to <a href="https://pareday.com">find a family and share a nanny</a>. It's simple and to the point.</strong></p>
<p>Pareday helps parents share a nanny, while hacking child care to be more personalized and cost-effective.
My wife and I have been using Pareday to find a family and within a week, met with a family 10 minutes away from our house. We simply signed up, posted what we were looking for, and Pareday told us who was nearby based on our zip code.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the features include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shows distance between you and other families using your zip code.</li>
<li>Send a nanny share request and a message intro.</li>
<li>Email alerts matching families to your start date, schedule, and minutes away from you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out <a href="https://pareday.com">Pareday.com</a> today and let me know in the comments what you think!</p>

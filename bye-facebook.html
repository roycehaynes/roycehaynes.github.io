                        <p>A few weeks ago I deactivated my Facebook account. It wasn't planned or on the to-do list, I just felt indifferent about the service.</p>
<p>Before deactivating, I checked out my activity stream, liked a few posts, wrote a comment, and looked at my notifications. The normal routine. After a few minutes went by, I was still gazing at Facebook in bed, and by then my conscious had woke up and asked, <mark>why does Facebook deserve your attention?</mark></p>
<p>Back in college, I enjoyed Facebook. I could view pics of me and my friends from the night before, keep up with old and new friends, find out about local parties, and stalk people without being judged. Facebook simply complimented my college experience. But even while attending college, Facebook didn't deserve my attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"in an age of personal technological revolution, we all need a more explicit philosophy for adopting tools. Without this clarity, we run the risk of drowning in a sea of distracting apps and shiny web sites." - <a href="http://calnewport.com/">Cal Newport</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Times have changed.</p>
<p>Facebook isn't relevant (to me) anymore and has championed a new level of distractions called social networks. I'm not anti social networks, but I'm against the bad habits they implicitly promote. </p>
<p>I have limited time and rather focus on projects, hang out with folks, and learn new tricks. </p>
<p>So yea, that's that. <mark>Less social is more</mark>.</p>
<p>If you wanna see what I'm doing on the internets socially, <a href="https://twitter.com/roycehaynes">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/roycehaynes">Instagram</a> are now my Facebook.</p>

                        <p>Blerd News (DRAFT)</p>
<p>I always thought it'd be cool to do a podcast. I've personally found podcasts to be a great medium to learning from others that will purposefully benefit my journey as an engineer and aspiring entrepeneur. I also think it'd be a great way to talk about thoughts in my head. </p>
<p>About once a week I spend 30 minutes or so chatting with friends, whether it's about a technical problem or an idea to build. Generally, talks lead to learning more about whatever we discussed and either experimenting or doing nothing at all.</p>
<p>For example, Brandon and I had a recent conversation on building web software that could handle enormous spikes. For context, Brandon leads tech at a startup that helps celebrities engage with their fans. We did ton of analysis on the problem, what tech to use, how to handle load, etc. The night Brandon was able to solve his issue and our conversaion (in part) help him fix a scaling issue. The conversation was juiced with interesting technical candy that it felt like our ramblings would be worth sharing. It would have also been great to get feedback and possible solutions better than the ones we had in our convo.</p>
<p>So when Brandon texted me saying we should give this podcast thing a try, it felt like a good call. I realized how valuable communication is to grow. I also recognize the value our unique experience in co-founding startups, failing, and working as software engineers could help those on the same trajectory or a step behind.  At the end of the day, we're learning as we go, and want to document what we learn and formulate lessons.</p>
<p>There's also a bigger purpose than just talking nerdy on air. We wanted to tell our journey as black software engineers in the startup space.  Between the two of us, we've had several folks come to us and ask how we got this far. As a side, I don't think my success is any cooler than the next, which is why I consider my journey marginal. However, people of color really want to hear from other people of color. Unfortunately, most of us don't discuss nerdy topics or life in the startup lane. </p>
<p>So, we decided to start Blerd News.</p>
<p>Blerd News is a podcast about the craft of software engineering and how we create in a startup environment. To some, this may be another outlet of the same chatter. Others, particularly people of color, this is an opportunity to hear from two black nerds (black + nerd = blerd) who have been there and done that. </p>
<p>We'll talk about recent tech news, cover topics on software, shipping software, interview folks, and how to be a successful engineer at a startup before, during, and after funding.</p>
<p>Check out blerdnews.com and let us know what you think. </p>
